In TypeScript, void is a type that denotes the absence of any type. 
It's commonly used to signify that a function doesn't return a value. 
When a function doesn't return anything, it implicitly returns undefined in JavaScript. 
TypeScript's void type is a more explicit way of expressing this.

Here's a simple example:

function sayHi(): void { 
    console.log('Hi!')
} 

let speech: void = sayHi(); 
console.log(speech); // Output: undefined
