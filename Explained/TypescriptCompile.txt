TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that every JavaScript code is a valid TypeScript code. 
TypeScript adds type information on top of JavaScript code, allowing for more robust development 
and better tooling support. However, browsers and Node.js environments can only execute JavaScript, 
so before any TypeScript code is run in the browser, the information about types must be stripped out. 
This is what the TypeScript compiler does.



There are several scenarios where relying solely on TypeScript might not be the best choice:

    Handling User Input: 
    As previously discussed, TypeScript's static type checking isn't designed to handle user input validation directly. 
    While TypeScript can help you catch potential errors in your code due to incorrect usage of types, 
    it can't guarantee that user input will match the expected types.

    Dealing with External Data: 
    When working with external data sources, such as APIs, TypeScript's static type checking can be less effective. 
    The data returned from an API might not always match the types defined in your TypeScript code, leading to runtime errors. 
    In such cases, you would typically need to perform runtime validation of the data.

    Dynamic Data Structures: 
    TypeScript works well with structured data where the shape is known ahead of time. 
    However, when dealing with dynamic data structures, such as nested objects or arrays, 
    TypeScript's static type checking might not be sufficient. 
    You may need to use type assertions or type guards to ensure the correct handling of the data.
