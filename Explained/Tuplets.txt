In TypeScript, tuples are a data structure that allows you to store a fixed-size, 
ordered collection of elements of different types. Unlike arrays, which can hold 
elements of the same type and are resizable, tuples have a fixed length and 
each element in a tuple can be of a different type.


// Declaring a tuple
let myTuple: [number, string, boolean];

// Initializing the tuple
myTuple = [10, "Hello", true];

// Accessing elements of the tuple
console.log(myTuple[0]); // Output: 10
console.log(myTuple[1]); // Output: Hello
console.log(myTuple[2]); // Output: true


Tuples are useful when you want to work with a fixed number of elements, each potentially of a different type. 
They provide a way to enforce a specific data structure in TypeScript and can be used in scenarios where 
the order and types of elements are known and need to be preserved. However, keep in mind that accessing 
elements by index alone doesn't provide much context about what each element represents, 
so it's important to use tuples judiciously and consider using object structures if the data 
is more complex or requires more descriptive labels.
