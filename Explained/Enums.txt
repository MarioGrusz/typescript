In TypeScript, an enum (short for "enumeration") is a data type that allows you to define a set of named constants. 
Enums are useful when you have a fixed set of values that are logically related and you want to represent them 
in a more readable and maintainable way.

// Enum with explicitly assigned values
enum Direction {
    Up = "UP",
    Down = "DOWN",
    Left = "LEFT",
    Right = "RIGHT"
}


// Defining an enum named Color
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
}

// Using the enum
let myColor: Color = Color.Green;
console.log(myColor); // Output: 1
